# MonthlyReport

The Purpose of this project is to generate a Monthly Sales Report using data from QuickBooks Pro. 

I'm creating this program for a local small business (Owned by my parents, so I'm doing the work for free and making the project files public). The Monthly Sales Report was previously created by hand.

The goal of this project is to speed up the creation of the Monthly Sales Report.
