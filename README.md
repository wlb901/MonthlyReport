# MonthlyReport

The Purpose of this project is to generate a Monthly Sales Report using data from QuickBooks Pro. 

I'm creating this program for a local small business. The Monthly Sales Report was previously created by hand.
The goal of this project is to speed up the creation of the Monthly Sales Report.
