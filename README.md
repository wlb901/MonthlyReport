# MonthlyReport

The Purpose of this project is to generate a Monthly Sales Report using data from QuickBooks Pro. 

This program combines two csv files generated by QuickBooks. The first file is a list of each item sold. It contains the invoice number, customer name, item name, and item price. The second file is a list of invoice totals. It contains the invoice number and the invoice total. The two files are then combined into one file that breaks down data for each individual invoice. 

If the invoice total is equal to the sum of all item prices for an invoice number, it is a wholesale invoice. In that case, the invoice total is recorded in the WholeSale column and the TIS (Total Income Sale) column. Otherwise it is a taxed sale. The FET (Federal Excise Tax) column is calculated by adding each item price for the invoice that contains "F.E.T." in the item name, Disp column by each containing "DISPOSAL", Labor column by each containing "DISMOUNT" or "REPAIR", Scrap column by each containing "SCRAP TIRE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE", and Casing by each containing "CASING" or "ADJ". The TaxSale column is then calculated by subtracting fet, disposal, labor, scrap, and casing amounts from the invoice total. The TIS column again equals the invoice total. 

This data shows a full breakdown of each invoice for tax and total sales information.

I'm creating this program for a local small business (Owned by my parents, so I'm doing the work for free and have permission to make the project files public). The Monthly Sales Report was previously created by hand.

The goal of this project is to speed up the creation of the Monthly Sales Report.
